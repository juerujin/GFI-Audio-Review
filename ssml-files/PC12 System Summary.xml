PC 12 Systems Summary
<break time="1200ms"/>

Landing gear type and shock absorption system.
<break time="1200ms"/>
Tricycle retractable landing gear, hydraulically actuated, with mechanical down locks for the down position. Gear is held in the retracted position by hydraulic pressure. Loss of pressure will cause the gear to free fall. (after 200 minutes in the event of a power pack failure). <break time="500ms"/> Gear doors are spring loaded to the open position. Shock is absorbed through the pistons in the landing gear.
<break time="1200ms"/>

Brake system description.
<break time="1200ms"/>
Each main gear wheel is equipped with a hydraulically actuated single-disc brake on the inboard side of each wheel. The brake system is separate and independent from the aircraft hydraulic system. Whoever applies the most pressure will control the brakes between the two pilots.
<break time="1200ms"/>

Number of fuel nozzles and operation.
<break time="1200ms"/>
There are 14 duplex type fuel nozzles with each nozzle incorporating a primary and secondary valve. During engine start, the primary flow begins as soon as there is fuel pressure. The secondary flow kicks in above approximately 45% N.G. . Without the secondary flow, the engine will hang at 40 to 45% N.G. during start. For operations from normal idle through max power, all 14 nozzles function with fuel coming through both the primary and secondary valves.
<break time="1200ms"/>

Air induction system.
<break time="1200ms"/>
The engine air inlet is located at the front of the engine under the propeller spinner. Ram air entering the inlet flows through the ducting and an inertial separator system. It then enters the engine through a circular plenum chamber where it is directed to the compressor by guide vanes. The compressor air inlet incorporates a screen that will prevent the entry of large particles but does not filter the inlet air.
<break time="1200ms"/>

Compressor bleed system, compressor surge control, and system operation.
<break time="1200ms"/>
The compressor bleed valve system operates between 86 to 92% N.G. to prevent the axial compressor from overloading the centrifugal compressor at low RPMs, causing a compressor stall. (the axial compressor is more efficient at lower RPMs). The valve is located between the second and third axial stage. (P 2 point 5). P 3. ( the third stage axial compressor). air is conditioned. (depressurized). into P.X, which acts against the bypass valve to close the spring loaded valve as engine speed (and P 3 pressure) increases. The spring loaded valve opens when the engine speed drops below 92% until it is fully opened at 86%. Also, some of the heated P 2 point 5 air that is ducted out of the compressor section can be routed to the cabin and defroster for climate control during ground operations.

Prevention of water freezing in the fuel system.
<break time="1200ms"/>
Water freezing in the fuel system is prevented by the fuel/oil heat exchanger, which routes hot oil into the exchanger via a heat sensing mechanical bypass valve. The addition of PRIST anti-icing fuel additive prevents icing in the fuel system prior to the heat exchanger.
<break time="1200ms"/>

What happens if the fuel filter is blocked.
<break time="1200ms"/>
A red button will extend above the top of the fuel filter facing the bay door, thus indicating the filter is being bypassed. This has a preset to open at a pressure of 8 PSI. Maintenance will reset the button once the issue is resolved.
<break time="1200ms"/>

Function of the Fuel Control Unit.
<break time="1200ms"/>
The FCU determines the correct fuel schedule to produce desired engine power in response to the Power Control Lever, (PCL), and Condition lever movement in normal operations, or Manual Override lever, (M.O.R), movement during emergency operations.
<break time="1200ms"/>

How does the FCU, (through power control manipulation), control fuel flow?
<break time="1200ms"/>
The FCU power lever acts upon a pneumatic bellow which then increases or decreases the amount of fuel flow at a given rate, <break time="300ms"/> (this prevents a runaway in the fuel supply delta for the turbine engine). P3 air acts upon the N.G. governor, <break time="300ms"/> (which conditions the P3 air to P.Y. pressure) <break time="300ms"/>, and the bellows, to increase or decrease fuel flow as the power setting is altered, thus changing the P3 pressure, (and therefore the P.Y. pressure being applied to the bellows).
<break time="1200ms"/>

What is the function of the flow divider?
<break time="1200ms"/>
Divides metered fuel flow between the primary and secondary fuel manifolds as a function of fuel pressure.
<break time="1200ms"/>

How is residual fuel purged from the fuel manifold and nozzles during engine shutdown?
<break time="1200ms"/>

Primary propellor governor.
<break time="1200ms"/>
The Primary governor limits N.P. to 1700 RPM or 104% N.G.. It uses a speeder spring to regulate the supply of engine oil to the pitch change mechanism within the prop hub. The governor is shaft driven via the bevel gear which is fitted to the propeller shaft.
<break time="1200ms"/>


Overspeed propellor governor.
<break time="1200ms"/>
In the event of a primary governor failure, the Overspeed governor will limit N.P. to eighteen oh two RPM or 106% N.P. . Uses its own speeder spring and flyweights to detect an overspeed condition and regulate the supply of engine oil to the pitch change mechanism within the prop hub.
<break time="1200ms"/>


Fuel Topping propellor governor
<break time="1200ms"/>
The N.F. or fuel topping governor limits N.P. to eighteen fifty three RPM or 109% N.P. . It does this by limiting the fuel flow via the FCU by using an air-bleed lever, a P.Y. bleed orifice and lever, and a reset arm. The Nf governor also acts as the primary governor while in reverse.
<break time="1200ms"/>

<break time="1200ms"/>
The oil system is a closed loop, dry sump, with a single pressure element system that provides cooling and lubrication to engine bearings and the accessory gearbox. The oil system also provides heating to the fuel, as well as oil to the torque limiter and meter. Oil cooling is accomplished with the oil/fuel heat exchanger and a ram air oil cooler.
<break time="1200ms"/>

<break time="1200ms"/>

When will auto-ignition engage?
<break time="1200ms"/>
When I.T.T drops below 500 Celsius and N​.G.​ above 10%, prevents flameout at low power settings
<break time="1200ms"/>

How does the fire detection system work?
<break time="1200ms"/>
Consists of a closed tube containing helium with a central hydrogen core, when heated, the helium pressure increases and actuates the fire pressure switch. When heated intensely over a short period, the hydrogen is released, causing a pressure rise actuating the fire pressure switch. When the sensor tube is cooled, the average gas pressure is lowered, and the discrete hydrogen gas
returns to the core material.
<break time="1200ms"/>
